# Real Analysis - Day 1

* Fundamental results to be covered

  * Compactness
  * Sequential and functional limits
  * Continuity
  * Uniform convergence
  * Differentiation
  * Integration

## Chapter 1. The Real Numbers

### 1.1 Discussion: The Irrationality of sqrt(2)
* _A Mathematician's Apology_
* Mathematics is an **aesthetic** discipline.
* Beauty in a mathematical theorem is that the result has lasting and serious implications for a network of other mathematical ideas (see Jordan Peterson on "Canonical texts")
* This demonstrated that the concept of _length_ (geometry) was "stronger" than the concept of _number_ (arithmetic).
* Instead, we need to strengthen our notion of _number_.
