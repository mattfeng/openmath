# Map of Differential Equations
* Discrete equations
  * Function maps
  * Discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov) simulations
* Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
* Split and Partitioned ODEs
  * Symplectic integrators
  * IMEX Methods
* Stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs)
* Random differential equations (RODEs or RDEs)
* Differential algebraic equations (DAEs)
* Delay differential equations (DDEs)
* Mixed discrete and continuous equations
  * Hybrid Equations
  * Jump Diffusions
* (Stochastic) partial differential equations ((S)PDEs)
  * Both finite difference and finite element methods.


## Solvers
* (5th order) Tsitouras method
* Rosenbrock

## "Go-to" solver choices

|algorithm|use cases|
|:-------:|:-------:|
|``AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23())``|both stiff and non-stiff equations. This is a good algorithm to use if you know nothing about the equation.|
|``AutoVern7(Rodas5())``| both stiff and non-stiff equations in a way that's efficiency for high accuracy|
|``Tsit5()``|standard non-stiff. **first algorithm to try in most cases**|
|``BS3()``| fast low accuracy non-stiff|
|``Vern7()``|high accuracy non-stiff|
|``Rodas4()`` or ``Rodas5()``| small stiff equations with Julia-defined types, events, etc.|
|``KenCarp4()`` or ``TRBDF2()``|medium sized (100-2000 ODEs) stiff equations|
|``RadauIIA()``| really high accuracy stiff equations|
|``CVODE_BDF()``| large stiff equations|

## Ordinary differential equations
* **homogeneous.** right-hand side is zero (c.f. _nonhomogeneous_).
* **order.** the highest derivative in the differential equation.
* **linear.** linear function of the derivatives (dependent variables); independent variables (e.g. time, space) may be non-linear.
